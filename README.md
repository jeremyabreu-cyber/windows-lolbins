# windows-lolbins
A practical handbook documenting how attackers abuse legitimate Windows binaries (LOLBins) for living-off-the-land techniques, with analyst-focused detection gaps and defensive context.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is intended for:
- SOC analysts
- Incident responders
- Blue team engineers
- Anyone learning how attackers abuse legitimate Windows tooling

Each file documents a single Windows binary and focuses on:
- Legitimate administrative use
- Common attacker abuse patterns
- Relevant telemetry and blind spots
- Analyst decision-making during triage

This is not an exploitation guide.
It is a defensive reference designed to improve reasoning,
reduce alert fatigue, and highlight where detections commonly fail.
